# in it's current form it might be used to quickly generate
# email-to-sms gateway messages using a list of someones number@ISP format:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways
# with a sane sendmail .forwards file it can be easily parsed and email to SMS message can be dispatched
# the usage below might be for an online gaming guild who competes for in-game mobs with others
# twitter functionality via the 1.1 API is also added below to post the CGI text
# to a twitter account, if users are subscribed to it via SMS they will receive it
# the same way that the normal email-to-sms message is sent.

Step 1
  Install centos7 (or rhel7) on libvirt locally or on hypervisor

Step 2
  Save the qcow2 image but delete the VM

Step 3
  Create a number of VM qcow2 files using the above image as the
  backing file.  This is how you do this, e.g. suppose you want to 
  have 3 test VMs:

     cd /var/lib/libvirt/images/
     cp -p /var/lib/libvirt/images/centos7.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/centos7-base.qcow2
     rm -f centos7.qcow2 
     qemu-img create -b `pwd`/centos7-base.qcow2 -f qcow2 host-01.qcow2
     qemu-img create -b `pwd`/centos7-base.qcow2 -f qcow2 host-02.qcow2
     qemu-img create -b `pwd`/centos7-base.qcow2 -f qcow2 host-03.qcow2

Step 4
   Create 3 VMs (or as many as you need in your test env) using virt-manager
   For each, use a pre-existing disk image and use each of the above
   disk image files.

Step 5
   Use the reset.sh script (place it in /root/VIRT/ ) to reset
   your images.  This script calls:  "reset-images.sh" which should
   also be placed in /root/VIRT/

   Edit the reset-images.sh to match your libvirt network.


IMPROVEMENTS:
   Make the script more generic so that the paths are not hardcoded 
   to live in /root/VIRT/
